# Project 2 Generative Audio

Your Name, aschaecher2@huskers.unl.edu

## Abstract

<!-- Include your abstract here. This should be one paragraph clearly describing your concept, method, and results. This should tell us what architecture/approach you used. Also describe your creative goals, and whether you were successful in achieving them. Also could describe future directions. -->

For this project, I was fascinated with the relationship between generated works from a computer and human interpretation of a result. In particular, I 
was interested on the Turing Test developed by Alan Turing to determine whether or not a generated piece of audio can be familiar or even be recognizeable 
as regular human made works. This project will involve the use of 3 generated audio samples in the style of Classical Music and one human made music 
sample for evaluation. All the samples will be in piano composition with Midi files as a control output. The process will be to take individuals and 
judge each work by itself and selecting the one piece of audio that is an original musical composition. The sample selected will be compared to the other 
samples and a result will be acheieved in how close the generated samples are to a "human musical composition".


## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- `.wav` files or `.mp4`
- `.midi` files
- musical scores
- ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
